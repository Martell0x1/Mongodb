---

## üß† Tips While Studying

- Don't memorize, **experiment**.

## NoSql Vs Sql
- nosql = not only sql
- sql databases stores data in tables each table are related to other tables with a relationship
- nosql databases stores data in 4 different forms
	1- Documents
	2- Key-value 
	3- Wide-column
	4- Graph
- in the following content we will talk about each type in detailes

- ACID operations in sql

| Operation   | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Atomicity   | The database transaction must be compelety success or fail , Partial success is not allowd                 |
| Consistency | During the database transaction the RDBMS progress from one valid state to another (no valid data allowed) |
| Isolation   | Database transaction must occure in isolation from other transactions (a client who read must stull to client who write)
| Durability  | Data must be presist after a successful operation |

- BASE operations in nosql

| Operation   			| Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Basically Available   |The system is guaranteed to be available for querying by all users (no isolation)              |
| Soft state 			|The value stored in the system may change becuase of the eventual consistency model            |
| Eventualy Consistent  |We may see older versions of data when applying new transactions (no isolation) like in hadoop |


- Types of data:
	- Structuerd => a data thatha
	- simi-Structured
	- Un-Structured
	| Data   		 | Description |
	|----------------|-------------|
	| Structuerd     |Data that has a formal structure like |
	| simi-Structured|Data that is structure and un-structre in the same time (Facebook Posts , Emails) , JSON / XML         |
	| Un-Structured  |Data that has no formal structure like  images , reports ..etc |

	- NoSql databases are suitable for simi and un structured data
	- Sql databases are suitable for structured data

- Important Notes

- NoSQl databases are used in buissiness scinarios when data doesn't have a specific schema
- thus nosql dbs are said to be growing horizontally , and sql are said to be growing vertically
- growing horizontally means adding new features to a database (if we have data and we don't know it's schema we can add featuers (columns in sql))
- growing vertically means that we know the schema of out data and we insert new instances / samples of data to it.
- hence NoSql dbs are used with huge data that has no formal schema and can be distibuted.
- NoSql dbs have less constraints on data (unlike sql which has many constraints) which cases some data inconsistencies but this increase the performance (the higher constraints on data the higher proccessing power it needs to apply this constraints).

- nosql dbs has no standarizations as it's opensource.
- nosql has limited query capabilities (we cannot write complex queries like in sql)

- CAP Theory

- based on CAP theory the choose between different DBMS depends on what we really need in our buisiness (pick tow)

- Mangodb is document type nosql database

| **Aspect**                | **SQL Databases**                                                                 | **Document NoSQL Databases**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Structure**        | Table-based, organized into rows and columns. Suitable for structured data.       | Document-based, using formats like JSON, BSON, XML, or YAML. Suitable for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. |
| **Schema**                | Fixed schema, predefined and must be adhered to. Ensures data integrity and consistency. | Flexible schema, dynamic and adaptable data structures. Suitable for evolving data requirements. |
| **Performance and Scalability** | Vertically scalable (upgrade hardware). Efficient for complex queries and transactions. | Horizontally scalable (add more servers). Better for large-scale data and fast read/write operations. |
| **Query Language**        | Use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data.               | Use various query languages depending on the type of NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB's query language, JSON, XML, YAML, binary schema). |
| **Use Cases**             | Transactional systems, banking, ERP systems, user-oriented applications with multiple join operations. | Content management systems, e-commerce, real-time applications, IoT, and big data. |
| **Examples**              | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server.                                         | MongoDB, CouchDB, Amazon DocumentDB, ArangoDB. |
| **Data Model**            | Relational, with tables and relationships defined by foreign keys.                | Non-relational, with documents that can contain nested structures and arrays. |
| **Data Redundancy**       | Minimized through normalization.                                                 | Can occur to optimize performance, leading to potential data redundancy and consistency issues. |
| **Complexity in Joins**   | Support complex joins and transactions.                                           | Limited support for joins; often denormalized for performance. |
| **Learning Curve**        | Standardized SQL language, widely understood.                                     | May require learning new query languages and data modeling techniques. |
| **Data Integrity**        | Strong data integrity through constraints and transactions.                       | Data integrity can be managed but is less strict, relying more on application logic. |
| **Horizontal Scaling**    | Generally more difficult to scale horizontally.                                   | Designed for horizontal scaling, making it easier to handle large volumes of data. |
| **Vertical Scaling**      | Easier to scale vertically by upgrading hardware.                                 | Less common; horizontal scaling is more typical. |
| **Real-Time Applications**| Suitable for applications requiring complex transactions and joins.                | Optimized for fast read/write operations, ideal for real-time applications. |
| **Big Data**              | Can handle large datasets but may require sharding or partitioning.               | Designed to handle large datasets with ease, often used in big data applications. |
